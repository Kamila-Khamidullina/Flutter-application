## :page_facing_up: Overview

This is a cross-platform Flutter application. It works with [chucknorris.io API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). The app allows user to get jokes in three different ways. Jokes are fetched from the API.

The app is operated with the navigation bottom bar.

The first is "Category" page. There are displayed all the categories present in the API. 
If user chooses one of these categories, the joke on this category will be displayed. After that user can either continue reading jokes in this category on go back.

Another is "Random" page. This page is for those, who cannot or do not want to chose any category. It shows a random joke in a random category.

It allows user to type some query and get the answer from the Chuck Norris API. It either shows the responce or the message about the absence of the responce.
